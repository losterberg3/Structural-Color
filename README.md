# Abstract

Structural coloration, a color-generation mechanism often found in nature, arises from light–matter interactions such as diffraction, interference, and scattering, with micro- and nanostructured elements. Herein, we systematically study anisotropic, 3D-architected grating structures with polarization-tunable optical properties, inspired by the vivid blue of Morpho butterfly wings. Using two-photon lithography, we fabricate multilayered gratings, varying parameters such as height (through scanning speed and laser power), periodicity, and number of layers. In transmission, significant color transitions from blue to brown were identified when varying structural parameters and incident light polarization conditions (azimuthal angle and ellipticity). Based on thin film diffraction efficiency theory in the Raman–Nath regime, optical characterization results are analytically explained, evaluating the impact of each parameter variation. Overall, these findings contribute to technological implementations of polarization-sensitive, 3D-architected gratings for structural color applications.
